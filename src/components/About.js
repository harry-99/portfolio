        So first back in 2020 I initially took admission in a college, and
        decided to drop-out after a month, to do study on my own, to do
        something really big and to chase my dreams in my own way, this was a
        risk I know, but it started to work slowly and im learning new and
        latest technologies from internet, not the 60 years old stuff from
        college(pun intended). I'm not saying college is bad or like that. This
        is way i took and these are my personal openion.
      </p> */}
